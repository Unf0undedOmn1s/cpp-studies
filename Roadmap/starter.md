| **Week** | **Theme**                                          | **Description**                                                     | **Example Challenge**                                                                                                                        |
| :------: | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   **1**  | **Fundamentals & I/O**                             | Get comfortable with basic syntax, logic, and data types.           | Write a unit converter CLI app that converts between temperature, distance, and time units. Let the user choose which conversion to perform. |
|   **2**  | **Conditionals + Loops**<br>(Integrate Week 1)     | Apply logic & iteration while managing user input and control flow. | Create a Number Guessing Game with a difficulty menu (Easy, Hard). Track number of tries and give hints (“higher/lower”).                    |
|   **3**  | **Functions + Reusability**<br>(Checksum of 1 & 2) | Build modular programs using functions and reusing logic.           | Build a Math Trainer app that quizzes random arithmetic problems. Include a menu, scoring system, and levels.                                |
|   **4**  | **Arrays, Vectors & Aggregation**                  | Store and process data efficiently.                                 | Create a Gradebook Manager: input multiple students’ grades, calculate average, min/max, and sort results.                                   |
|   **5**  | **Strings + Arrays**<br>(Checksum 1–4)             | Combine string manipulation with previous logic.                    | Make a Password Strength Analyzer: check if passwords meet criteria (length, digits, uppercase, etc.). Save and analyze multiple passwords.  |
|   **6**  | **Pointers & Memory**                              | Understand references, pointers, and memory access.                 | Write a Memory Inspector: take a list of numbers and manually compute sum, average, and variance using pointer arithmetic.                   |
|   **7**  | **Structs + Functions + Files**                    | Introduce data organization and persistence.                        | Create a Contact Manager that saves contacts (name, phone, email) to a file, allows searching, editing, deleting.                            |
|   **8**  | **Classes & Encapsulation**<br>(Checksum)          | Turn structs into full OOP systems.                                 | Rebuild the Contact Manager as a class with methods and data hiding. Add file saving/loading.                                                |
|   **9**  | **Inheritance & Polymorphism**                     | Explore relationships between classes.                              | Make a Library System: base `Item` class → derived `Book`, `DVD`, `Magazine`, each with unique behaviors.                                    |
|  **10**  | **Dynamic Memory & Templates**<br>(Checksum)       | Get hands-on with pointers and templates.                           | Implement your own mini `Vector` class template (like `std::vector`): support push, pop, resize, and print.                                  |
|  **11**  | **STL & Error Handling**                           | Use standard containers and manage bad input.                       | Create a Banking System using `std::map` for accounts, with error handling for invalid operations.                                           |
|  **12**  | **Final Project**                                  | Combine all topics into something meaningful.                       | Build a CLI Adventure Game or Task Manager app with multiple classes, file storage, and structured logic.                                    |

## After 12 Weeks — Phase 2: Algorithms & Data Structures
After completing the 12-week foundation, continue with Phase 2, focusing on:
- Sorting algorithms (implement by hand)
- Linked lists
- Recursion-based puzzles
- Graphs and trees

- Simple game logic or simulations
