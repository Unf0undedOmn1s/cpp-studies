## Double variable
- Use of the "double" variable in cases such as radius, area, perimeter.

## Pointers
- A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
- Pointers allow functions to modify variables outside their own scope by accessing their memory addresses.
- They are used for dynamic memory allocation, efficient array handling, and implementing data structures like linked lists.
- Syntax: `type *pointerName;` (e.g., `int *p;`)
- The value at the address a pointer points to can be accessed or modified using the `*` operator (dereferencing).
