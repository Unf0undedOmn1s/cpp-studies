# C++ Studies - OOP University of Ioannina | Dept of IT & Telecommunications

This repository contains notes and example code for learning C++ programming. It covers fundamental and advanced topics, including variables, pointers, functions, memory management, and object-oriented programming concepts.

## Topics Covered

- **Pointers**: How to declare, use, and dereference pointers.
- **Functions**: Passing arguments by value and by reference.
- **Dynamic Memory**: Allocating and freeing memory at runtime.
- **Friend Functions**: Accessing private members of a class from non-member functions.
- **Inheritance**: Creating class hierarchies and reusing code.
- **Polymorphism**: Using virtual functions and dynamic binding.

## How to Use

1. Open the code files in your C++ IDE or editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. Read the comments and notes for explanations.
3. Compile and run the `.cpp` files to see the output and experiment with the code.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Basic knowledge of programming concepts
